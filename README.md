# PyDiar

This repo contains simple to use, pretrained/training-less models for speaker diarization.

## Supported Models

- [x] Binary Key Speaker Modeling

  Based on [pyBK](https://github.com/josepatino/pyBK) by Jose Patino which implements the diarization system from "The EURECOM submission to the first DIHARD Challenge" by Patino, Jose and Delgado, HÃ©ctor and Evans, Nicholas

If you have any other models you would like to see added, please open an issue.

## Usage

This library seeks to provide a very basic interface. To use the Binary Key model on a file, do something like this:

```python
import numpy as np
from pydiar.models import BinaryKeyDiarizationModel, Segment
from pydiar.util.misc import optimize_segments
from pydub import AudioSegment

INPUT_FILE = "test.wav"

sample_rate = 32000
audio = AudioSegment.from_wav(INPUT_FILE)
audio = audio.set_frame_rate(sample_rate)
audio = audio.set_channels(1)

diarization_model = BinaryKeyDiarizationModel()
segments = diarization_model.diarize(
    sample_rate, np.array(audio.get_array_of_samples())
)
optimized_segments = optimize_segments(segments)
```

Now `optimized_segments` contains a list of segments with their start, length and speaker id

## Example

A simple script which reads an audio file, diarizes it and transcribes it into the WebVTT format can be found in `examples/generate_webvtt.py`.
To use it, download a vosk model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models and then run the script using

```shell
poetry install
poetry run python -m examples.generate_webvtt -i PATH/TO/INPUT.wav -m PATH/TO/VOSK_MODEL
```
